## A new Flutter application  for NGO


## Challenges it solves

So The big problem of NGO not reaching out to each and every person in the society can be solved by this . Now most of the people will have food , clothes or other living essentials .
Also with the Help of WE CARE!  We will be able to raise funds and also will be able to tell people who need help and how they can help them.
Also our project can help improve the roads and sanitation of an area and improve women and kid’s safety so that they can live freely.
All the essential data about cases will be shared with media partners so that we will be able to spread the news to a larger no. of people and government  so that they can take some actions to improve those conditions. 

## Challenges we ran into

1. Clearly defining your goals.
Clearly defining the goals and requirements will make or break your web app. It all starts with the vision for our app and website. That affects everything that follows. 
There are a few key considerations in any development process: 
Who are your intended users? 
What experience do you want to give them?
What are your must-have design features?
What are your technical requirements?
Once we have defined all of these things, we can start to address them.
2. Choosing the right tech stack.
We should always choose a tech stack that aligns with the problems we are trying to solve. For example, we probably won’t need a complex tech stack for a simple web application, or a tech stack that helps you optimize for scalability when your user base will be a consistent size. 
We should consider whether your tech stack is widely used in the industry. While choosing the tech stack always make sure that the tech stack has thorough documentation. So, we choose HTML, CSS, and Javascript for web development and Flutter for app development
 
3. UX
User experience (UX) encapsulates the reactions, perceptions, and feelings your users experience while engaged in your application. It’s the feeling of ease and simplicity that we get from great design. It’s also the frustration that we feel when interacting with poor design. 
4. Performance and speed
No user likes slow load times. And they can have real consequences for your business. If our application is slow, users won’t wait. They’ll leave. This is the reality of web application and app development issues today.
